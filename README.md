## Developed a machine learning model to predict products going in backorders using a highly imbalanced dataset.<br/>

#### - Applied SMOTE to balance the classes, followed by XGBoost for modeling.<br/>
#### - Enhanced model accuracy through Grid Search and Random Search for optimal hyperparameter tuning.
